UsbTreeView V2.5.1.0 - Shows the USB Device Tree
Freeware by Uwe Sieber - www.uwe-sieber.de

Works under Windows 2000, XP and higher

Usage:
UsbTreeView [/R:filename]

/R:filename   write (silently) a report to filename



UsbTreeView is based upon the USBView sample from the Windows Driver Kit for Server 2003.

Improvements:
- better icons in the treeview
- refresh on device change performed asynchronously, selected item stays selected
- shows additional information gathered from the Windows device management
- shows drive letters/mountpoints and COM ports
- can perform safe removal, device restart and port restart
- custom font and color for the right pane
- toolbar with jump-lists for easily finding devices in complex trees

About Unknown Descriptors

There are two reasons why decriptors cannot be decoded and therefore
shown as "Unknown":
- decoding is not implemented
- the device's InterfaceClass is 0xFF (vendor specific), so class specific
  descriptors cannot be decoded since their class is unknown

So, if you have an unknown descriptor and the interface class is not 0xFF
then please let me know, maybe I find the right specification document
and can add the decoding for it.

For an unknown reason HID descriptors often cannot be read, Windows
returns ERROR_GEN_FAILURE or ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER. As far as I have
seen it depends alone on the device but another user reported that
some device's hid descriptor can be read under NT6 but not under NT5.



About "Safe Removal" and "Restart"

On Safe Removal UsbTreeView first calls the configuration management call
CM_Query_And_Remove_SubTree. On success the device has the problem code
21 which is CM_PROB_WILL_BE_REMOVED. A code 21 device can be reactivated
by performing a DIF_PROPERTYCHANGE class installer call. This is what
UsbTreeView does if you select "Restart device".
But CM_Query_And_Remove_SubTree needs admin previleges, otherwise it fails
with CR_ACCESS_DENIED. In this case CM_Request_Device_Eject is called
which works without admin previleges but leads to problem code 47 which
is CM_PROB_HELD_FOR_EJECT. Such a device cannot be reactivated alone.
A reactivation is possible by restarting the port or the whole hub it is
attached to. But the latter of course restarts all devices attached to
the hub.

In all cases UsbTreeView just performs the system call and shows a
message-box if Windows returns an error. But Windows does not always
return an error, even there was one, so sometimes nothing happens at all.



About "Restart Port"

This calls IOCTL_USB_HUB_CYCLE_PORT which simulates a disconnect and
reconnect of the attached device.
It is available under XP but usually only for hubs which run with the
Microsoft default driver. 3rd party drivers usually return
ERROR_UNKNOWN_FUNCTION.
Under Vista and Windows 7 it is no more supported by the Windows standard
drivers, it always fails with ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED.
Since Windows 8 it works again but in contrast to XP admin previleges
are required. Without admin previleges it fails as under Vista and Win7
with ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED.


About the Debug-Port

In Microsoft's USBView sample there is a list of USB host controllers
and their debug port. I've put the table into UsbTreeView, it shows
then in the properties of the host controller a line like so:
DebugPort (from List): 1
Windows 8 has extended USB information, it reports for each port if it
is debug capable and this works indeed (seen on a i945G Chipset with ICH7).



USB Mouses

If an USB mouse is moved while the tool requests its USB properties there
is usually an error because the mouse just has more important things to
do. UsbTreeView tries then for some seconds to get this information.
You might see the yellow question mark at the mouse's tree node for a
moment which disappears as soon as you stop moving the mouse.
This retry mechanism is done for all type of devices but usually its a
mouse where it helps.


Information shown in the tree-view

UsbTreeView is optimized for speed, therefore USB descriptors are not
gathered before a device is selected in the tree-view. So, information
which come from USB descriptors cannot be shown in the tree-view, it
all comes from the Windows device manager.
This is also why creating a full report takes a moment.
